 * You go to a local store to buy something, and you decide to pay for it by using your card.

   the clerk doesnâ€™t bother to check what kind of card you have given.
 
 * Even if you have given a debit card or credit card it not even matter, they will simply swipe it.
   This is what the abstraction between clerk and you to relay on Card processing
