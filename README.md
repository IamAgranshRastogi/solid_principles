# ******** SOLID PRINCIPLES In JAVA ********
## SOLID Acronym
### 1. [S] Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) :
"*A class should have only one reason to change.*"

### 2. [O] Open closed Principle (OSP) :
"  Software Entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be *open for extension, but closed for Modification*. "

### 3. [L] Liskov substitution Principle (LSP) : 
" *Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes.
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.*"

### 4. [I] Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) :
"*Do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them / methods that it does not use.*"

### 5. [D] Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) :
"*High-level modules should not depend on the low-level module but both should depend on the abstraction.*"


These 5 principles have changed the world of object-oriented programming, and also changed the way of writing software. 
It also ensures that the software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and refactor. 

In this repository, we will discuss SOLID principles in Java with proper example: 

The principle can be well understood with an example. Imagine there is a class called BankService which performs following operations.
1. Withdraw
2. Deposit
3. Print Pass Book
4. Get Loan Info
5. Send OTP
